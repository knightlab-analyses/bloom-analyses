    "# Identify the candidate blooming bacteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to identify candidate bacteria which bloom under shipping conditions. We identified cadnidates in two parts: first, we looked for bacteria which grew at room temperature in storage studies. We also looked at shipped American Gut samples and compared them to fresh frozen fecal samples. We used the combined technique because the storage studies were limited by size, while the comparison between studies is noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, this process will involve the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the datasets (Mayo and Se-Jin storage studies and AG, PGP, UK-Twins and Whole grain feces)\n",
    "2. Calculate the fold change per sOTU in the storage studies\n",
    "3. Calculate the fold change in AG compared to fresh frozen studies (PGP, UK-Twins and Whole grain feces)\n",
    "4. Identify candidate blooming bacteria by combining the fold changes in 2,3\n",
    "5. Plot the scatter of the fold change per sOTU with highlighting the candidate blooming bacteria\n",
    "6. Plot taxonomy plots before and after bloom filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading the necessary python functions. "

    "In conclusion, we can take advantage of the microbes identified to be blooming in previous studies, combined with comparison between shipped and fresh frozen samples, to identify candidate taxa that bloom in storage conditions in the American Gut project.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of performing such analysis on a sub-OTU level (i.e. the output of the Deblur algorithm), is that we can identify and remove the exact blooming bacterial sequences, whereas using traditional OTU based methods would require removal of the blooming bacteria and all close sequences, which can lead to much higher numbers of bacteria removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that choosing the number of candidate blooming bacteria to remove is a type-1/type-2 balance. Removal of more bacteria will reduce the effect of shipment, at the cost of losing more bacteria for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all bacteria may change during shipment, it seems only a small number of them exhibit a drastic growth. By removal of as little as the top 8 blooming bacteria, we can greatly reduce the effect of shipment. This leads to a great reduction in the noise within American Gut samples (since not all samples are undergo the same shipment conditions/duration), as well as enable comparison to other, fresh frozen studies.\n"
