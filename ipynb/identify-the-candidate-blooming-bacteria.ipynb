    "# Identify the candidate blooming bacteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to identify candidate bacteria (as observed by 16S rRNA V4 reads) which appear to bloom under shipping conditions. We identify candidates in two parts: first, we'll look for bacteria which grew at room temperature in storage studies; second, we'll look at shipped American Gut fecal samples and compared them to fresh-frozen fecal samples. We use the combined technique because the storage studies were limited in sample size and individuals, while the comparison with fresh-frozen studies offers many more individuals and samples. \n",

    "An advantage of performing such analysis on a sub-OTU level (i.e. the output of the Deblur algorithm), is that we can identify and remove the exact blooming bacterial sequences, whereas using traditional OTU based methods would require removal of the blooming bacteria and all close sequences, which can lead to much higher numbers of bacteria removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that choosing the number of candidate blooming bacteria to remove is a type-1/type-2 balance. Removal of more bacteria will reduce the effect of shipment, at the cost of losing more bacteria for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While all bacteria may change during shipment, it seems only a small number of them exhibit a drastic growth. By removal of as little as the top 8 blooming bacteria, we can greatly reduce the effect of shipment. This leads to a great reduction in the noise within American Gut samples (since not all samples are undergo the same shipment conditions/duration), as well as enable comparison to other, fresh frozen studies.\n"
