    "# Identify the candidate blooming bacteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to identify candidate bacteria (as observed by 16S rRNA V4 reads) which appear to bloom under shipping conditions. We identify candidates in two parts: first, we'll look for bacteria which grew at room temperature in storage studies; second, we'll look at shipped American Gut fecal samples and compared them to fresh-frozen fecal samples. We use the combined technique because the storage studies were limited in sample size and individuals, while the comparison with fresh-frozen studies offers many more individuals and samples. \n",

By removal of as little as the top 8 blooming bacteria, we can greatly reduce the effect of shipment. This leads to a great reduction in the noise within American Gut samples (since not all samples are undergo the same shipment conditions/duration), as well as enable comparison to other, fresh frozen studies.\n"
